🛠️ How to use Auto DVBAPI:

Use this option only when you're dealing with encrypted (card) channels that use a system other than BISS, and the CW (Control Word) is constant — also known as a "frozen CW".

Go to the channel where the CW is frozen.

🟡 Press the yellow button and enter the fixed CW key you already have — it will be saved into the SoftCam.key file.

⌨️ After entering the key and pressing Enter, scroll down and press the green button in the plugin.

🔄 The plugin will automatically map and add the key and channel SID as a BISS entry into your oscam.dvbapi or ncam.dvbapi file.

✅ The channel will instantly open — no extra steps needed!

📝 This feature helps convert non-BISS channels with fixed CWs into BISS-compatible entries, making them easier to manage automatically.
